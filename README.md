To use the application, open the unity project on "SolScene" and press play.

The dataset can be accessed through Assets/Resources/newDataset.csv
When you start the application you will be able to search by Title, Date or Publisher. You can copy+paste any of these entries from their cells
in the spreadsheet or enter them, but they must match exactly.
For this reason I recommend searching a year between 2010-2020 for the most reliable search results.
If no nodes generate after your search, the term was entered incorrectly. Restart the applcation.

You can move around in space with WASD and vertically with Q+E.
You can click on any generated node with left click and its data will appear on the back wall.
While a node is selected you can press space to generate a new network with that as the base.
You can press right click to enable the cursor and interact with the menu options.
